# Tapestry

The cloud infrastructre code and deployment guide for the Graph Database version of the WordPress plugin - Tapestry ([Website](https://www.home.tapestry-tool.com/)). This is a plugin for Wordpress that allows creating non-linear, collaborative, and interactive content. Originally designed to work using a relational database, this cloud deployment alongwith the Graph Database version of the [plugin](https://github.com/UBC-CIC/tapestry-wp-graphDB) aims to use Amazon Neptune as the primary database for the plugin, which would facilitate faster graph traversals for large Tapestries.
